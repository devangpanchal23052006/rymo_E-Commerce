This is a front-end e-commerce website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. The project is inspired by a tutorial from the YouTube channel **"ABC"**, where a complete website was developed step-by-step. I recreated the entire project by following the video to practice and strengthen my front-end development skills.
